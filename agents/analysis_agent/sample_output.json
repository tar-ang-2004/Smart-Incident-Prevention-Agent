(3) Cascade to payment gateway: Checkout service cannot persist payment state to database, causing payment requests to timeout after 10s. Repeated timeouts trigger payment_gateway circuit breaker to OPEN state. (4) Cascade to inventory service: Similar pattern - inventory reservations cannot be persisted, causing inventory service calls to fail, triggering inventory_service circuit breaker to OPEN. (5) Amplification: Request queue builds to maximum (500/500) as failed requests accumulate faster than they can be processed. (6) Resource pressure: CPU/memory elevation (89%/93%) from accumulated threads and queued requests. (7) Overall impact: 47.8% error rate, 76.3% availability. The temporal sequence (database exhaustion → service failures → circuit breakers → queue saturation → resource pressure) and correlation across multiple components strongly confirms this cascading pattern.
